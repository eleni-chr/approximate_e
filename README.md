# approximate_e
The function computes Euler's number, e. Instead of going to infinity, the function stops at the smallest k for which the approximation differs from exp(1) (i.e., the value returned by MATLABâ€™s built-in function) by no more than the positive scalar, delta, which is the input argument. The first output of the function is the approximate value of e, while the second is k (see attached image for what k is in the formula).
